# Changelog

All notable changes to Paddock are recorded here. Newest first.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-05-14

### Added
- **Full season on Calendar.** Calendar no longer caps at 100 sessions; shows every upcoming session through the end of the season for each followed series.
- **Versioning + Changelog page.** Footer now shows the app version, links to this changelog.

### Fixed
- **Hero card respects followed series.** The "Up next" card on Home previously ignored your followed-series preference and showed the soonest session across every championship. It now respects your `/settings` selection.
- **Long-location truncation.** Session cards used to truncate full street addresses (e.g. "Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, Route du Circuit 55, 4970 Stavelot, Belgium"). Now show only the venue name.

### Infra
- Web push notifications back online (VAPID + Vercel KV + cron). KV must be connected in the Vercel dashboard for subscriptions to persist.

## 0.1.0 — Initial

- PWA shell, multi-series ICS ingest, session grouping by day/weekend, series detail pages, followed-series filter (localStorage), settings page.
