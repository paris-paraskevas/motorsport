# Paddock — time plan

Day-by-day intent. Updated at session start (write the plan) and session end (mark done / partial / skipped, sketch tomorrow).

Items here should map to entries in `IDEAS.md` Now / Next.

**Format conventions:**
- One section per ISO week (`## Week of YYYY-MM-DD`).
- One subsection per day (`### Mon YYYY-MM-DD`).
- Bullets are intent at the start of the day; append outcomes at the end (`→ done`, `→ partial: <note>`, `→ skipped: <why>`).
- Explicit "won't touch this session" line stops scope creep.
- `Active:` line under each day logs real active time per the `[+Nm]` prompt prefix (see `CLAUDE.md` → Time tracking). Example: `Active: 25 + 40 + 15 = 1h 20m`.

## Week of 2026-05-11

### Sat 2026-05-16

Morning ship marathon:

- → done: ship `0.9.1` weekend correctness fixes — phantom 3 am times (Session.dateOnly through the pipeline, "TBC" display, live-now + notify cron skips), canonical F1 round numbers via `content/series/<slug>/rounds.json`, sessions.json override loader, FE Monaco 2026 sessions curated.
- → done: bootstrap `CLAUDE.md` operating manual + `IDEAS.md` ledger + `SCHEDULE.md` time plan (`0.9.2`).
- → done: mature `CLAUDE.md` with ESPA protocol + seven extensions + Mode awareness + four communication discipline rules; reversed commit-attribution policy (no more `Co-Authored-By`) (`0.9.3`).
- → done: scaffold two-contributor workflow — `CONTRIBUTING.md` + `ONBOARDING.md` + reversed CLAUDE.md push-to-main rule. CI workflow parked. (`0.9.4`)
- → done: triage `IDEAS.md` Now/Next; close Saturday; sketch Sunday; port handoff from memory to `docs/HANDOFF.md`; memory file becomes a redirect stub. (`0.9.5`)
- → done: handoff appendix — flat 60-item open-items inventory in `docs/HANDOFF.md` (`0.9.6`).
- → done: per-prompt active-time tracking — `[+Nm]` prefix → `SCHEDULE.md` Active line + memory rule (`0.9.7`).

Afternoon mini-session — **pre-Fotis cutoff scoped**:

- Scope rule set ([[project-paddock-pre-fotis-cutoff]]): clear open items by Mon/Tue (2026-05-18/19). All new ideas → Inbox only. After Tue Fotis sit-down happens.
- Plan: doc-sync `0.9.6` + `0.9.7` to `docs/HANDOFF.md`, then start Tier 1 — browser-verify `0.9.1`, `00:00` mystery, then sessions.json + rounds.json curation scout for non-F1 series with upcoming rounds.
- Won't touch this afternoon: Supabase work, SEO baseline (S5), Tier 4 multi-session items (only chip if Tier 1+2+3 finish early).
- All commits from here on follow the new branch + PR + squash-merge flow (`CONTRIBUTING.md`). No more direct pushes to main.

### Sun 2026-05-17

Pre-Fotis cutoff continues. Priority order:

1. **Tier 1 finish** — sessions.json + rounds.json curation pass across non-F1 series with rounds in next 30d, endurance-series weekend grouping audit, ESLint cleanup + husky pre-commit, delete unused `lib/onboarding.ts`.
2. **Tier 2 polish** — custom `app/error.tsx`, `/api/cron/health`, news-filter persistence, push click handler deep-link, DRY notifications components, hero images in push payload, fold `overview.md` into F1 About, home hero next-2-3-sessions, Settings "Your devices", install Resend.
3. **Tier 2 pull-ups** — session cards tap-to-expand, driver season-trend chart, common topics on Rules tab, Clerk dark retheme.

Won't touch this session: Supabase code, comments thread, predictions, anything from `IDEAS.md` Parked or `Killed`.

Active:
(time-tracking starts the next session — prefix each prompt with `[+Nm]` and I append here)

### Mon 2026-05-18

Pre-Fotis cutoff continues — Tier 1+2 carry-over from Sun. Begin Tier 3 if Tier 1+2 done.

Won't touch this session: anything kicked to post-Fotis carry-over.

Active:
_(awaiting [+Nm] prefixes)_

### Tue 2026-05-19 — Fotis sit-down day

**Tier 3 investigation docs:** data-sources research first (Ergast/jolpica, MotoGP web API, FIA feeds, aggregators), then Supabase scoping doc. JS-site XHR reverse-engineering + Champions JSON cleanup investigation if time remains.

**End-of-day:** pre-Fotis cutoff rule expires after the sit-down. Resume normal IDEAS.md triage. Delete `project-paddock-pre-fotis-cutoff` memory.

Won't touch this session: anything not Tier 1/2/3 unless explicitly pulled in during the sit-down.

Active:
_(awaiting [+Nm] prefixes)_

## Backlog stubs (next 1–2 weeks, no firm date yet)

- **Supabase migration full execution** — schema build, scrapers, ingestion crons. Scoping doc ships pre-Fotis (Tue); execution post-Fotis.
- **SEO baseline (S5)** — sitemap, robots, JSON-LD, per-page metadata, OG image generators. Multi-day; deferred to post-Fotis.
- **Detail-page enrichment (S6)** — `/drivers/[slug]`, `/teams/[slug]`, F1 History, Rules tab. Post-Fotis.
- **Native non-F1 results + standings (S7)** — MotoGP / WEC / IndyCar / NASCAR. Post-Fotis.

## How to use this file

- **At session start:** if today's date doesn't have an entry, create one. Write the intent as a bullet list. Add the "won't touch" line.
- **Mid-session:** don't edit this file (use `IDEAS.md` Inbox for new ideas).
- **At session end:** convert intent bullets to outcomes (`→ done` / `→ partial` / `→ skipped`). If tomorrow's plan is obvious, stub it.
- **Weekly:** when a week wraps, roll old days into an archive note or trim the file as it grows. Don't let the file balloon past ~200 lines.
